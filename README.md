# EMAILFEATUREUSINGJSP

Steps to Set Up
Download and Install Tomcat:

Download the latest version of Apache Tomcat from the official website.
Extract the downloaded ZIP or TAR file to a location of your choice.
Run Tomcat:

Navigate to the bin directory within your Tomcat installation folder.
Locate and run the startup.bat file (on Windows) or startup.sh file (on Linux/Mac) to start Tomcat. This will start the Tomcat server.
Set Up Your Project in Tomcat:

Go to the webapps directory within your Tomcat installation folder.
Create a new folder for your project, e.g., SubscribeApp.
Inside the SubscribeApp folder, create a file named index.jsp.
Add Code to index.jsp:

Copy and paste your JSP code into the index.jsp file.
Create the MySQL Database:

Open MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client.

Create a new database named email_subscription.

Create a table named subscribers with the following SQL command:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE subscribers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
Ensure that you have the appropriate MySQL username and password set in your index.jsp file.

Access Your Application:

Open a web browser.
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/SubscribeApp.
You should see the Subscribe App interface. From here, you can use the subscription and unsubscription features.

Notes
Ensure that your Tomcat server is running before attempting to access the application.
Update the MySQL database credentials in the index.jsp file to match your local setup.
For production use, ensure proper security practices for handling email and database credentials.
